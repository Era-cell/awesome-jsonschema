> A curated list of awesome JSON Schema resources, tutorials, tools, and more.

JSON Schema is a JSON-based format to annotate and validate JSON documents with
a vibrant community. JSON Schema is defined by a set of IETF specifications and
it is the industry-standard for defining the structure and meaning of JSON
documents.

## Papers

- (2022) [Witness Generation for JSON Schema](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12849) - JSON Schema is an important, evolving standard schema language for families of JSON documents. It is based on a complex combination of structural and Boolean assertions, and features negation and recursion. The static analysis of JSON Schema documents comprises practically relevant problems, including schema satisfiability, inclusion, and equivalence. These three problems can be reduced to witness generation: given a schema, generate an element of the schema, if it exists, and report failure otherwise.
- (2021) [TILT: A GDPR-Aligned Transparency Information Language and Toolkit for Practical Privacy Engineering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445925) - We present TILT, a transparency information language and toolkit explicitly designed to represent and process transparency information in line with the requirements of the GDPR and allowing for a more automated and adaptive use of such information than established, legalese data protection policies do.
- (2021) [Deriving Semantics-Aware Fuzzers from Web API Schemas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10328) - Discusses JSON Schema canonicalization and JSON Schema instance derivation in the context of property-based testing of APIs.
- (2020) [Type Safety with JSON Subschema](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12651) - Deciding whether one schema is a subschema of another is non-trivial because of the richness of the JSON Schema specification language. Given a pair of schemas, our approach first canonicalizes and simplifies both schemas, then decides the subschema question on the canonical forms, dispatching simpler subschema queries to type-specific checkers.
- (2020) [JSON Schema Inference Approaches](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-65847-2_16) - In the context of document NoSQL databases, namely those assuming the JSON data format, this paper focuses on several representatives of the existing inference approaches and provide their thorough comparison.
- (2020) [Challenges in Checking JSON Schema Containment over Evolving Real-World Schemas](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-65847-2_20) - This paper presents the results of an empirical study of the first generation of tools for checking JSON Schema containment which is applied to a diverse collection of over 230 real-world schemas and their altogether 1k historic versions.
- (2019) [What Are Real JSON Schemas Like?](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34146-6_9) - A first empirical analysis of a curated collection of real-world JSON Schemas. Knowing what real JSON Schemas are like (to borrow from a title of a related study on DTDs) helps practitioners and researchers in making realistic assumptions when building tools for JSON Schema processing.
- (2018) [Top-Down Model-Driven Engineering of Web Services from Extended OpenAPI Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9000020) - Shows how OpenAPI can be extended to add implementation details inside models. These extensions link services to assemblies of components that describe computations. Hence a top-down development process that keeps model and implementation aligned.
- (2018) [An Approach for Schema Extraction of JSON and Extended JSON Document Collections](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8424731) - This paper presents an approach that extracts a schema from a JSON or Extended JSON document collection stored in a NoSQL document-oriented database or other document repository. Aggregation operations are considered in order to obtain a schema for each distinct structure in the collection, and a hierarchical data structure is proposed to group these schemas in order to generate a global schema in JSON Schema format.
- (2017) [Schema Inference for Massive JSON Datasets](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01491765) - Recent years have seen the widespread use of JSON as a data format to represent massive data collections. JSON data collections are usually schemaless. While this ensures several advantages, the absence of schema information has important negative consequences: the correctness of complex queries and programs cannot be statically checked, users cannot rely on schema information to quickly figure out structural properties that could speed up the formulation of correct queries, and many schema-based optimizations are not possible. In this paper we deal with the problem of inferring a schema from massive JSON data sets.
- (2017) [Example-Driven Web API Specification Discovery](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-61482-3_16) - In this paper we present an example-driven discovery process that generates model-based OpenAPI specifications for REST Web APIs by using API call examples. A tool implementing our approach and a community-driven repository for the discovered APIs are also presented.
- (2017) [Definition of REST web services with JSON schema](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.2466) - The aim of this article is to demonstrate how JSON Schema, and particularly the JSON Hyper Schema extension, is suitable to describe JSON-based web services that follow the REST architectural pattern.
- (2016) [Foundations of JSON Schema](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2872427.2883029) - In this paper we provide the first formal definition of syntax and semantics for JSON Schema and use it to show that implementing this layer on top of JSON is feasible in practice.
- (2015) [Schema extraction and structural outlier detection for JSON-based nosql data stores](https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/2420) - Rather than designing the schema up front, extracting a schema in hindsight can be seen as a reverse-engineering step. Based on the extracted schema information, we propose set of similarity measures that capture the degree of heterogeneity of JSON data and which reveal structural outliers in the data.
- (2014) [Jsongen: a quickcheck based library for testing JSON web services](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2633448.2633454) - This article describes a systematic approach to testing behavioural aspects of Web Services that communicate using the JSON data format. To generate random JSON data for populating tests we have developed a new library, jsongen, which given a characterisation of the JSON data as a JSON schema, (i) automatically derives a QuickCheck generator which can generate an infinite number of JSON values that validate against the schema, and (ii) provides a generic QuickCheck state machine which is capable of following the (hyper)links documented in the JSON schema, to automatically explore the web service.
- (2012) [User profile integration made easy: model-driven extraction and transformation of social network schemas](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2187980.2188227) - This paper presents, firstly, a semi-automatic approach to extract schema information from instance data. Secondly, transformations of the derived schemas to different technical spaces are utilized, thereby allowing, amongst other benefits, the application of established integration tools and methods. Finally, as a case study, schemas are derived for Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn.
